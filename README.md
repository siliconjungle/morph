# morph

An attempt at creating a file format which stores the history of changes to multi-modal media files.

## Purpose

There's an idea of bring your own client. What about bring your own modality? I should be able to open a podcast in my favourite text editor and edit the transcript. I should be able to open a video in my favourite audio editor and edit the sound. I should be able to open images in 3D modelling software and generate 3D models from them.
